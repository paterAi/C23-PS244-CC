Tried making the search feature api using express js with the firebase firestore database, then after that did the deploy using the gcp app engine service, it failed, then switched to using the firebase functions service, until finally it worked and got the endpoint url, then tested on postman until it finally worked , then do api documentation using the documentary postman tool
